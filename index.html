  <h1>Recommended Sites</h1>
  <p>Nails Magazine is a great resource for nails as it provides the latest product and services in the industry. The site uses a lot of different elements and has a lot of options that are easy to navigate for a professional seeking inforamtion on nails. However, it would be helpful if they added better search feature since they have a lot of content on the site. Take a look for yourself:</p> <br><a href="http://www.nailsmag.com/">Nails Magazine</a><br />
